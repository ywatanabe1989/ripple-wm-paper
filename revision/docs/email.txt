Editor and Reviewer comments:

Please note that manuscripts with inadequate language quality will not be accepted in the journal. If editors and / or reviewers indicate that language revisions are required for your manuscript, we strongly encourage using a professional language editing service. Elsevier's Language Editing services provides professional and prompt editing of scientific language for research submissions (https://webshop.elsevier.com/language-editing-services/language-editing/). All manuscripts edited with Elsevier's Language Editing services are accompanied by a certificate that may be submitted to the journal as proof for language editing. Poor language may lead to rejection of your manuscript even at the revision stage.

This is an interesting study. I have some comments as follows,
The introduction of the study should situate the current research in the context of existing literature, and clearly address the motivation. For example,
1)the authors mentioned sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are associated with memory consolidation, recall, and neural plasticity, all of which are from long-term memory functions. Then, what's the rationale for investigating SWRs in working memory (WM)?
2)what's the motivation of exploring neural representations or trajectories (NT) during SWR periods? Has this metric been utilized to study working memory or cognitive functions? how the findings of the present study compare with past research?

In the methods section, a more detailed description is warranted. For instance, the frequency range defining SWRs is set at 80-140 Hz, different from previous studies that identified sharp-wave ripples in higher frequency bands (e.g., 140-200 Hz, in "SPW-Rs are fast (140-200 Hz) oscillations in field potential recordings that are superimposed on a slow field potential transient", see doi:https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1571, Nature, 2005). The authors should explain the criteria for selecting this frequency range.

In the results, while the authors showed their reasons focusing on the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus, what were the results for the other subregions? If these results were negative in other subregions, they could serve as a control to underscore the functions of CA1.

In the discussion section, the authors discovered a positive correlation between set size and the neural trajectory (NT) distance during the encoding and retrieval phases, not for other phase combinations. An explanation for this phenomenon would be beneficial. Besides, has similar analyses done in previous studies of working memory or cognitive functions? How do the discoveries of this research contrast with prior findings?

There are some typoes, please fix them, for example:
1)on page 2, line 94, (Figure ??S1)
2)on page 4, lines 219-220, (Figures 3D and ??)


Reviewer #2: 1. The authors provide sufficient details for most of the analysis. However, some methods are presented with insufficient details.
2. All the results that support the conclusion are directly shown.
3. I find that the conclusion drawn by the authors are an exaggerated extension of the results obtained. I think a major flaw is present in the definition of 'states', which are the core of the study. Clear definition of the term 'state' is needed, together with additional analysis to show their existence. At this stage, the results are too weak to support the conclusion.
4. The study complies with the ethical guidelines.

Major comments:
- Defining 'encoding' and 'retrieval' states requires a careful, complete, and clear analysis. From Fig.2, it seems that NT points are scattered and do not have stable 'states'. This could be a major flaw of the study, since the 'transition between states' could be no longer valid. To define states, authors would need to explicitly show that points that belong to 'encoding' and 'retrieval' phases are clustered in different regions of the state space and have small overlap.

- The results presented in Fig.7 needs to be compared with the cosine distance distribution of random vectors in the 3-dimensional space. Among the ones shown in Fig.7, which are the significant results?

- From Fig.1, the encoding NT seems to be close to 0 the whole time, apart from when SWR+ appears. To validate this switching between encoding and retrieval states, the authors would need to compare the cosine similarity distribution of rSWR+ with gEgR, and the distribution of rSWR+ with gR. If the authors find no significant difference in the two distributions, then they cannot claim the switching between encoding and retrieval states.

- The authors do not provide sufficient details on the SWR clustering with UMAP. Please define how you define the silhouette score and which features do you use for clustering.

- I find that section 3.6 and Fig.6 are not adding any information to the study. The results obtained with the initial 3-dimensional projection provide the same results as the ones in section 3.6.

- The authors find positive correlation between set size and the distance between median NT position in encoding (gE) and median NT position in recall (gR). Distances are log-transformed. Is this correlation present also when distances are not log-transformed? I find that the reason presented in Discussion for log- transformation ('log-normal distributions are prevalent in the central nervous system') is not valid. I think that this Discussion paragraph should be deleted.

Minor comments:
- Is the result shown in Fig.2c from a single patient?

- Fig.3c is not informative. By definition, SWR+ and SWR- will have the same duration distribution.

- Contrary to what is written in the Figure caption, Fig.4d shows the mean SWR incidence, but not the confidence interval. In addition, the SWR- incidence is not present.

- In Fig.3 the authors do not use SWR information. The reference to Fig.3 in section 3.6 is not correct.


- In Discussion, the phrase 'hippocampal neurons form unique NTs, primarily during SWR' is not correct. Hippocampal activity always forms NT, by definition. Please remove or rephrase.

- In Discussion, the main findings (distance of NT bigger in hippocampus, correlation between set size and gEgR) are repeated twice.


- In Discussion, the phrase 'the potential bias does not substantially challenge our main findings' is not clear. Why does the potential bias do not affect the main findings?
