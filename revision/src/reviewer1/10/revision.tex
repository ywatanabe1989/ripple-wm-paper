\DIFaddend In conclusion, this study illustrates that during a WM task in humans, hippocampal activity fluctuate between encoding and retrieval states \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, uniquely transitioning }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in a manner dependent on memory load and task, with notable transition }\DIFaddend from encoding to retrieval \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{states }\DIFaddend during SWR events. These findings offer novel insights into the neural correlates and functionality of working memory within the hippocampus.
