Thank you for your inquiry regarding the motivation for exploring neural trajectories (NT) during sharp-wave ripple (SWR) periods. We have added the following sentence to clarifyy the rationale: The emphasis on NTs is derived from the imperative to comprehend the continuous, dynamic representation of neurons and the facilitation of visualization and comprehension.

% The impetus for investigating NT during SWR periods is primarily due to limitations observed in existing studies which focus on spatial navigation in rodents. These limitations include insufficient temporal resolution, significant noise in signal detection during rodent movement, and the challenges of generalizing these findings to humans and non-navigation tasks. Given these challenges, exploring SWRs in a controlled, less noisy environment is crucial for understanding their potential role in working memory (WM) tasks in humans.\\
