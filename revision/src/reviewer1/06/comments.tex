In the methods section, a more detailed description is warranted. For instance, the frequency range defining SWRs is set at 80-140 Hz, different from previous studies that identified sharp-wave ripples in higher frequency bands (e.g., 140-200 Hz, in "SPW-Rs are fast (140-200 Hz) oscillations in field potential recordings that are superimposed on a slow field potential transient", see doi:https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1571, Nature, 2005). The authors should explain the criteria for selecting this frequency range.\\
