Thank you for your constructive feedback. Based on your suggestions, we decided to focus on WM contexts rather than long-term memory correlations to better situate the current work. Specifically, we have revised the Introduction section as follows:\\

% We also acknowledge that SWRs have been predominantly linked with long-term memory functions. However, recent research suggests a broader role for SWRs, potentially extending to working memory (WM) processes. Our hypothesis is driven by several constraints in current experimental setups.\\
% \\
% To begin with, ethical and safety considerations significantly limit access to the human hippocampus, thereby restricting direct observations. In animal studies, on the other hand, memory performance is frequently evaluated through spatial navigation tasks that depend on place cells. These tasks encounter difficulties due to their low temporal resolution, which hinders the precise determination of when an animal acquires and uses WM information.\\\\
% \\
% Additionally, sharp wave-ripple (SWR) detection has primarily conducted during "offline" states, such as when animal speeds are typically below 4 cm/s. This constraint is partially due to noise contamination, such as electromyography, which impedes SWR detection during active navigation. In fact, while some studies have linked SWRs with WM tasks in rodents, SWR detections were only conducted while the animals were stationary. This represents only a portion of WM tasks and presents difficulties in capturing dynamic hippocampal activity.\\
% \\
% Overall, these limitations complicate the study design for elucidating the relationships between SWRs and WM performance. By addressing these issues, in our study, we aim to provide a clearer understanding of the potential involvement of SWRs in WM processes in humans. We explored the dataset of human hippocampal iEEG recording while subjects performing WM tasks. This study facilitates our understanding in real-time cognitive processes.\\
