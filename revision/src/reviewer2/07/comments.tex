\revTwoComment{
- The authors find positive correlation between set size and the distance between median NT position in encoding (gE) and median NT position in recall (gR). Distances are log-transformed. Is this correlation present also when distances are not log-transformed? I find that the reason presented in Discussion for log- transformation ('log-normal distributions are prevalent in the central nervous system') is not valid. I think that this Discussion paragraph should be deleted.\\

Thank you very much for your suggestion. Correlations were not found when log-transformation is not applied. However, pair-wise comparisons remains the same statistics as we used Brunner-Munzel test, which is an non-parametric method based on rank data.\\
Following your suggestion, we have deleted the discussion paragraph.\\
