We applogie for the confusion. We intended to reiterate our findings to show the motivation to focus on the encoding and retrieval phases, because we found memory-load dependent NT distances between these phases.\\
\\
Upon considering, we have decided to delete the text as follows:\\
\\
Having observed NT ’jumping’ during SWR (Figure 5), we visualized the three-dimensional NTs of pre-, mid-, and post-SWR events during the encoding and retrieval phases (Figure 6).\\
To provide two-dimensional visualization, we linearly …\\
