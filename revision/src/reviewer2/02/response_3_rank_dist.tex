Additionally, we calculated the distance from $g_{E}$/$g_{R}$ to NT during Encoding and Retrieval phases and applied statistical tests for rank data, which were transformed within each session to exclude differences in scales across patients or sessions. The results showed $g_{E}$ was closer to NT during Encoding, and $g_{R}$ was closer to NT during Retrieval, confirming the existence of distinct states in the NT spaces.\\
