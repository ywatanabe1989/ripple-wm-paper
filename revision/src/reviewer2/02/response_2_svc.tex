Next, we have analyzed the existence of states. Specifically, we applied a support vector machine classifier (SVC) in a self-supervised manner with cross-validation. As a result, the balanced accuracy of the classification regarding the four phases was $0.417 \pm 0.117$ (mean $\pm$ std; 10-fold cross-validation method with 10 repeats), which is significantly higher than the chance level (Table~\ref{tab:04}).\\
