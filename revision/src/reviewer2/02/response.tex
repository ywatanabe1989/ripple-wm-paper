% Major comments:
% - Defining 'encoding' and 'retrieval' states requires a careful, complete, and clear analysis. From Fig.2, it seems that NT points are scattered and do not have stable 'states'. This could be a major flaw of the study, since the 'transition between states' could be no longer valid. To define states, authors would need to explicitly show that points that belong to 'encoding' and 'retrieval' phases are clustered in different regions of the state space and have small overlap.

% Clear definition of the term ’state’ is needed, together with additional analysis to show their existence.

Thank you for your comments regarding the definitions of states. We would like to respond in the following three dimensions.\\
\\
First, the definition of "states" should have been clarified. In the current study, "states" are equivalent to the median coordinate of NTs for a session (= 50 trials) in the corresponding phase ($\mathrm{g_{F}}$ for fixation, $\mathrm{g_{E}}$ for encoding, $\mathrm{g_{M}}$ for maintenance, and $\mathrm{g_{R}}$ for retrieval phase). The choice of the median, rather than the mean, for example, is due to concerns about the significant effects of outliers and the need to find a stable metric, which aligns with your point.\\
\\
Second, Figure~\ref{fig:02}A was constructed using data from Subject \#6, Session \#2, encompassing all 50 trials. The point here is that trials here include the following six different conditions: memory load (4, 6, and 8) and task type (Match IN versus Mismatch OUT). Thus, the instability of the scatter plots in Figure~\ref{fig:02}A might not be invalid. To check the effects of these merged conditions, we scatter-plotted NTs for each condition separately. [FIXME ->][<- FIXME]\\
\\
Lastly, to quantify this, we checked whether the four phases are linearly distinguishable in these spaces using a support vector machine classifier (SVC) in a self-supervised manner with cross-validation methods. The balanced accuracy of the classification was XXX, which was above the chance level. Thus, while we are uncertain about how concentrated and segregated each state should be, we believe the median values have the representative metrics for each phase.\\
\\
Considering all factors, irrespective of the "stability of states", we assert that our findings continue to be valid. In light of these considerations, we have accordingly updated our manuscript:\\
