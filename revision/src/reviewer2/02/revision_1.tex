  \subsection{\DIFadd{Defining Phase States}}
  \DIFadd{Phase states were defined as the neural trajectory (NT) during each phase of the 8-s task, comprising 160 x 50-ms bins:
  }

  \begin{equation}
    \DIFadd{S_F = \{N_{i} | i = 1, ..., 20\}
  }\end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
    \DIFadd{S_E = \{N_{i} | i = 21, ..., 60\}
  }\end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
    \DIFadd{S_M = \{N_{i} | i = 61, ..., 120\}
  }\end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
    \DIFadd{S_R = \{N_{i} | i = 121, ..., 160\}
  }\end{equation}

  \DIFadd{where $S_F$, $S_E$, $S_M$, and $S_R$ represent the states of fixation, encoding, maintenance, and retrieval, respectively; $N_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ NT coordinate.
  }

  \subsection{\DIFadd{Geometric Medians of States}}
  \DIFadd{The geometric median was calculated from the middle 1 s (20 x 50-ms bins) of each state:
  }

  \begin{equation}
    \DIFadd{g_F = f_{GM}(\{N_{i} | i = 1, ..., 20\})
  }\end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
    \DIFadd{g_E = f_{GM}(\{N_{i} | i = 31, ..., 50\})
  }\end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
    \DIFadd{g_M = f_{GM}(\{N_{i} | i = 81, ..., 100\})
  }\end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
    \DIFadd{g_R = f_{GM}(\{N_{i} | i = 131, ..., 150\})
  }\end{equation}

    ; and $N_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ NT coordinate, calculated from 50-ms unit activity data.

  \DIFadd{The geometric median is calculated by minimizing the sum of distances to the sample points:

  \begin{equation}
    \DIFadd{x_{GM} = \arg\min_{z \in \mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{i=1}^n \|z - x_i\|_2.
