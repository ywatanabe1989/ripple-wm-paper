\revTwoComment{
- From Fig.1, the encoding NT seems to be close to 0 the whole time, apart from when SWR+ appears. To validate this switching between encoding and retrieval states, the authors would need to compare the cosine similarity distribution of rSWR+ with gEgR, and the distribution of rSWR+ with gR. If the authors find no significant difference in the two distributions, then they cannot claim the switching between encoding and retrieval states.\\
