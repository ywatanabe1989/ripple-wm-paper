Thank you very much. We have explained it in details, which is necessary for communication with readers.
One could argue that the NT distance increase from O during SWRs (Figure 5) may be artificially inflated towards higher values due to channel selection using UMAP clustering on spike counts. However, this potential bias does not affect the direction of NT, the memory-load dependency, nor the WM task dependency identified in this study.
