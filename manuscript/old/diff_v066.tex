Working memory (WM) is crucial for a multitude of cognitive functions, but its underlying neural mechanisms at play remain to be fully understood. Interestingly, the hippocampus and sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)--- transient and synchronous oscillation observed in the hippocampus --- garner recognition for their significance in memory consolidation and retrieval, albeit their correlation with WM tasks remains to be elucidated. Here we show that during a WM task, multi-unit activity patterns in the hippocampus display distinctive dynamics, especially during SWR periods. This study analyzed intracranial electroencephalography data from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of nine patients with epilepsy, recorded during an eight-second Sternberg task. Utilizing Gaussian-process factor analysis, we extracted low-dimensional neural representations or trajectories (NT) within MTL regions during the Sternberg WM task. The results revealed significant variations in NT of the hippocampus compared to those of the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala. Additionally, the distance of the NT between the encoding and retrieval phases was dependent on memory load. Crucially, hippocampal NT oscillated during the retrieval phase between encoding and retrieval states in a task-dependent manner. Notably, these fluctuations shifted from encoding to retrieval states during SWR episodes. These findings reaffirm the role of the hippocampus in WM tasks and propose a hypothesis: the hippocampus transitions its functional state from encoding to retrieval during SWRs in WM tasks.

Consequently, there is a relative paucity of research on the impact of SWRs on WM performance \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{jadhav_awake_2012}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD

%DIF >  Working memory (WM) plays a vital role in everyday life, yet its neural mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. One region implicated in WM processing is the hippocampus, a critical area for memory \cite{scoville_loss_1957, squire_legacy_2009, boran_persistent_2019, kaminski_persistently_2017, kornblith_persistent_2017, faraut_dataset_2018, borders_hippocampus_2022, li_functional_2023, dimakopoulos_information_2022}. Understanding the role of the hippocampus in working memory is key to enhancing our understanding of cognitive processes and may potentially influence cognitive abilities.

%DIF >  During WM tasks, transient, synchronized oscillations known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) \cite{buzsaki_hippocampal_2015} are observed to replay recent and future memory traces \cite{foster_reverse_2006, karlsson_awake_2009, carr_hippocampal_2011, pfeiffer_hippocampal_2013}. Moreover, awake SWRs are functionally associated with WM performance in several-day scales, as demonstrated by selective SWR suppressions \cite{girardeau_selective_2009, jadhav_awake_2012, singer_hippocampal_2013} and prolongation \cite{fernandez-ruiz_long-duration_2019}, as well as functional lesions in the dentate gyrus \cite{sasaki_dentate_2018}. Some studies also underscore the role of SWRs in WM performance, coordinated with other oscillation components \cite{tamura_hippocampal-prefrontal_2017, daume_control_2024}. In addition to these findings, SWRs are observed a few seconds before memory recall \cite{wu_hippocampal_2017, norman_hippocampal_2019, norman_hippocampal_2021}, suggesting their necessity for successful WM processing.

%DIF >  However, these behavioral memory functions have primarily been investigated using rodent navigation tasks that rely on place cells \cite{okeefe_hippocampus_1971, okeefe_place_1976, ekstrom_cellular_2003, kjelstrup_finite_2008, harvey_intracellular_2009}. Thus, the temporal resolution of WM tasks was not sufficient to distinguish exact timings of memory acquisition, retrieval, and decision-making processes. Furthermore, in rodent navigation tasks, SWRs are detected predominantly during immobility (\textit{e.g.}, when the animal moves at a speed of less than 4 cm/s at reward locations) \cite{foster_reverse_2006, karlsson_awake_2009, carr_hippocampal_2011, pfeiffer_hippocampal_2013, jadhav_awake_2012, singer_hippocampal_2013, fernandez-ruiz_long-duration_2019}, potentially due to contamination from electromyographical noise \cite{Watanabe_2021}, leading to a lack of generalization to human WM functionality. These limitations prompted us to investigate the correlation between SWRs and the exact timings of WM using a high temporal resolution dataset in humans in a controlled, less noisy experimental setting.

In fact, the firing patterns of hippocampal place cells have been identified within dynamic, nonlinear three-dimensional hyperbolic spaces in rats \cite{zhang_hippocampal_2022}.

%DIF >  Considering these factors, this study hypothesize that hippocampal neurons in humans exhibit low-dimensional neural trajectories (NTs) that depend on WM load, particularly during SWR periods. To test this hypothesis, we employed a dataset of patients performing an eight-second Sternberg task with high temporal resolution (1 s for fixation, 2 s for encoding, 3 s for maintenance, and 2 s for retrieval) \cite{boran_dataset_2020}. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) were recorded for these patients. To investigate low-dimensional NTs, we utilized Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA), an established method for analyzing neural population dynamics \cite{yu_gaussian-process_2009, churchland_stimulus_2010, lin_functional_2011, churchland_neural_2012, ecker_state_2014, kao_single-trial_2015, gallego_neural_2017, wei_orderly_2019, kim_corticalhippocampal_2023}.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset used in this study, which is publicly available, comprises nine epilepsy patients performing a modified the Sternberg task \cite{boran_dataset_2020}. This task includes four phases: fixation (1s), encoding (2s), maintenance (3s), and retrieval (2s). During the encoding phase, participants were presented with a set of four, six, or eight alphabet letters. They were then tasked with determining whether a probe letter displayed during the retrieval phase had previously appeared (the correct response for Match IN task) or not (the correct response for Mismatch OUT task). Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals were captured with a 32 kHz sampling rate within a 0.5--5,000 Hz frequency range, using depth electrodes in the MTL regions: the anterior head of the left and right hippocampus (AHL and AHR), the posterior body of the hippocampus (PHL and PHR), the entorhinal cortex (ECL and ECR), and the amygdala (AL and AR), as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:01}A and Table~\ref{tab:01}. The iEEG signals were subsequently downsampled to 2 kHz. Correlations between variables such as set size and correct rate were examined (Figure~\ref{fig:s01}S1). Multiunit spike timing was determined via a spike sorting algorithm \cite{niediek_reliable_2016} using the Combinato package (\url{https://github.com/jniediek/combinato})(Figure~\ref{fig:01}C).

\subsection{Calculation of NT using GPFA}
NTs, also referred to as 'factors', in the hippocampus, EC, and amygdala were determined using GPFA \cite{yu_gaussian-process_2009} applied to the multi-unit activity data for each session, performed with the elephant package (\url{https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/gpfa.html}). The bin size was set to 50 ms, without overlaps. Each factor was z-normalized across all sessions, and the Euclidean distance from the origin ($O$) was then computed.
\\
\indent
For each NT within a region such as AHL, geometric medians ($\mathrm{g_{F}}$ for fixation, $\mathrm{g_{E}}$ for encoding, $\mathrm{g_{M}}$ for maintenance, and $\mathrm{g_{R}}$ for retrieval phase) were calculated by determining the median coordinates of the NT during the four phases. An optimal GPFA dimensionality was found to be three using the elbow method obtained by examining the log-likelihood values through a three-fold cross-validation approach (Figure~\ref{fig:02}B).

\subsection{Identifying SWR candidates from hippocampal regions}
Potential SWR events within the hippocampus were detected using a widely used method \cite{liu_consensus_2022}. LFP signals from a region of interest (ROI) like AHL, were re-referenced by deducting the averaged signal from locations outside the ROI (for instance, AHR, PHL, PHR, ECL, ECR, AL, and AR). The re-referenced LFP signals were then filtered with a ripple-band filter (80--140 Hz) to determine SWR candidates, marked as $\textrm{SWR}^+$ candidates. SWR detection was carried out using a published tool (\url{https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/ripple_detection}) \cite{kay_hippocampal_2016}, with the bandpass range adjusted to 80--140 Hz for humans \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\\
\indent
Control events for $\textrm{SWR}^+$ candidates, labeled as $\textrm{SWR}^-$ candidates, were detected by randomly shuffling the timestamps of $\textrm{SWR}^+$ candidates across all trials and subjects. The resulting $\textrm{SWR}^+/\textrm{SWR}^-$ candidates were then visually inspected.

\\
\indent
$\textrm{SWR}^+/\textrm{SWR}^-$ candidates in these predetermined CA1 regions were categorized as $\textrm{SWR}^+/\textrm{SWR}^-$, and thus they no longer retained their candidate status. The duration and ripple band peak amplitude of SWRs were found to follow log-normal distributions. Each time period of SWR was partitioned relative to the time from the SWR center into pre- (at $-800$ ms to $-300$ ms from the SWR center), mid- (at $-250$ to $+250$ ms), and post-SWR (at $+300$ to $+800$ ms) times.
\\
\indent
\subsection{Statistical Evaluation}
Both the Brunner--Munzel test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were executed using the SciPy package in Python \cite{virtanen_scipy_2020}. Correlational analysis was conducted by determining the rank of the observed correlation coefficient within its associated set-size-shuffled surrogate using a customized Python script. The bootstrap test was implemented with an in-house Python script.

\section{Results}
\subsection{iEEG Recording and NT in MTL Regions during the Sternberg Task}
Our analysis employed a publicly accessible dataset \cite{boran_dataset_2020}, which comprises LFP signals (Figure~\ref{fig:01}A) from MTL regions (Table~\ref{tab:01}) recorded during the execution of the modified Sternberg task. We extracted SWR$^+$ candidates from LFP signals that were filtered in the 80--140 Hz ripple band (Figure~\ref{fig:01}B), originating in all hippocampal regions (refer to Methods section). Meanwhile, SWR$^-$ candidates, control events for SWR$^+$ candidates, were defined at the same timestamps but distributed across different trials (Figure~\ref{fig:01}). The dataset encompassed multi-unit spikes (Figure~\ref{fig:01}C), recognized via a spike sorting algorithm \cite{niediek_reliable_2016}. Employing GPFA \cite{yu_gaussian-process_2009}, we applied this to 50-ms windows of binned multi-unit activity without overlaps to determine the NTs, or factors, of MTL regions by session and region (Figure~\ref{fig:01}D). We normalized each factor per session and region, for instance, session \#2 in AHL of subject \#1. We then calculated the Euclidean distance from the origin ($O$) (Figure~\ref{fig:01}E).

\subsection{Correlation of Hippocampal NT with the Sternberg Task}
Figure~\ref{fig:02}A exhibits a distribution of median NTs, comprising 50 trials, within the three main factor spaces. Utilizing the elbow method, we established the optimal embedding dimension for the GPFA model as three (Figure~\ref{fig:02}B). The NT distance from the origin ($O$) --- represented as $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{M} \rVert}$, and $\mathrm{\lVert g_{R} \rVert}$ --- in the hippocampus surpassed the corresponding distances in the EC and amygdala (Figure~\ref{fig:02}C \& D).\footnote{Hippocampus: Distance = 1.11 [1.01], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 195,681 timepoints; EC: Distance = 0.94 [1.10], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 133,761 timepoints; Amygdala: Distance = 0.78 [0.88], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 165,281 timepoints.}
\\
\indent
Similarly, we computed the distances between the geometric medians of four phases, namely $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{E} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{R} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$, and $\mathrm{\lVert g_{M}g_{R} \rVert}$. The hippocampus showed larger distances between phases than those in the EC and amygdala. \footnote{Hippocampus: Distance = 0.60 [0.70], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 8,772 combinations; EC: Distance = 0.28 [0.52], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 5,017 combinations (\textit{p} $<$ 0.01; Brunner--Munzel test); Amygdala: Distance = 0.24 [0.42], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 7,466 combinations (\textit{p} $<$ 0.01; Brunner--Munzel test).}

\subsection{Memory-Load-Dependent NT Distance between Encoding and Retrieval States in the Hippocampus}
Regarding memory load in the Sternberg task, we observed a negative correlation between the correct rate of trials and the set size, which denotes the number of letters to be encoded (Figure~\ref{fig:03}A).\footnote{Correct rate: set size four (0.99 \textpm 0.11, mean \textpm SD; \textit{n} = 333 trials) vs. set size six (0.93 \textpm 0.26; \textit{n} = 278 trials; \textit{p} $<$ 0.001, Brunner--Munzel test with Bonferroni correction) and set size eight (0.87 \textpm 0.34; \textit{n} = 275 trials; \textit{p} $<$ 0.05; Brunner--Munzel test with Bonferroni correction). Generally, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001 for Kruskal--Wallis test; correlation coefficient = - 0.20, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001.} Concomitantly, a positive correlation was noted between the response time and set size (Figure~\ref{fig:03}B).\footnote{Response time: set size four (1.26 \textpm 0.45 s; \textit{n} = 333 trials) vs. set size six (1.53 \textpm 0.91 s; \textit{n} = 278 trials) and set size eight (1.66 \textpm 0.80 s; \textit{n} = 275 trials). All comparisons \textit{p} $<$ 0.001, Brunner--Munzel test with Bonferroni correction; \textit{p} $<$ 0.001 for Kruskal--Wallis test; correlation coefficient = 0.22, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001}.
\\
\indent
Next, we discovered a positive correlation between set size and the NT distance separating the encoding and retrieval phases ($\mathrm{log_{10}\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$) (Figure~\ref{fig:03}C).\footnote{Correlation between set size and $\mathrm{log_{10}(\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$): correlation coefficient = 0.05, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001. Specific values: $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$ = 0.54 [0.70] for set size four, \textit{n} = 447; $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$ = 0.58 [0.66] for set size six, \textit{n} = 381; $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$ = 0.61 [0.63] for set size eight, \textit{n} = 395.}. However, distances between other phase combinations did not highlight statistically significant correlations (Figures~\ref{fig:03}D and \ref{fig:s02}).

\subsection{Detection of Hippocampal SWRs from Putative CA1 Regions}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To enhance the precision }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The precise localization of recording electrodes within the hippocampus presents significant challenges in human studies, primarily due to the typical unavailability of postmortem histological confirmation. To improve the accuracy }\DIFaddend of recording sites and SWR detection \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, we approximated the electrode placements in the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the hippocampus, we established an inclusion criterion that required the electrode to be in the putative }\DIFaddend CA1 regions of the hippocampus\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{using distinguished }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. This was based on distinct }\DIFaddend multi-unit spike patterns \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{observed }\DIFaddend during SWR events \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{compared to baseline periods}\DIFaddend . SWR$^+$/SWR$^-$ candidates from each session and hippocampal region were embedded in two-dimensional space using UMAP (Figure~\ref{fig:04}A).\footnote{Consider the AHL in session \#1 of subject \#1 as a case in point.} With the silhouette score as a quality metric for clustering (Figure~\ref{fig:04}B and Table~\ref{tab:02}), recording sites demonstrating an average silhouette score exceeding 0.6 across all sessions were identified as putative CA1 regions.\footnote{The identified regions were the AHL of subject \#1, AHR of subject \#3, PHL of subject \#4, AHL of subject \#6, and AHR of subject \#9.} (Tables~\ref{tab:02} and \ref{tab:03}). We identified five putative CA1 regions, four of which were not indicated as seizure onset zones (Table~\ref{tab:01}).
\\
\indent
Subsequently, SWR$^+$/SWR$^-$ candidates within these putative CA1 regions were labeled as SWR$^+$ and SWR$^-$, respectively\footnote{These definitions produced equal counts for both categories: SWR$^+$ (\textit{n} = 1,170) and SWR$^-$ (\textit{n} = 1,170).} (Table~\ref{tab:03}). Both SWR$^+$ and SWR$^-$ manifested identical durations \footnote{These definitions result in equal durations for both categories: SWR$^+$ (93.0 [65.4] ms) and SWR$^-$ (93.0 [65.4] ms).} due to their definitions and followed a log-normal distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:04}C). During the initial 400 ms of the retrieval phase, an increase in SWR$^+$ incidence was found\footnote{SWR$^+$ increased against the bootstrap sample; 95th percentile = 0.42 [Hz]; \textit{p} $<$ 0.05.} (Figure~\ref{fig:04}D). The peak ripple band amplitude of SWR$^+$ surpassed that of SWR$^-$ and followed a log-normal distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:04}E).\footnote{SWR$^+$ (3.05 [0.85] SD of baseline, median [IQR]; \textit{n} = 1,170) vs. SWR$^-$ (2.37 [0.33] SD of baseline, median [IQR]; \textit{n} = 1,170; \textit{p} $<$ 0.001; Brunner--Munzel test).}.

\subsection{Transient Change in Hippocampal NT during SWR}
We assessed the 'distance' of the NT from the origin ($O$) during SWR events in both encoding and retrieval phases (Figure~\ref{fig:05}A). Observing the increase in distance during SWR, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:05}A, we categorized each SWR into three stages: pre-, mid-, and post-SWR. Hence, the distances from the origin $O$ during those SWR intervals are identified as $\mathrm{\lVert \text{pre-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert \text{mid-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$ and others.
\\
\indent
As a result, $\mathrm{\lVert \text{mid-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$\footnote{1.25 [1.30], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 1,281 in Match IN task; 1.12 [1.35], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 1,163 in Mismatch OUT task} exceeded $\mathrm{\lVert \text{pre-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$\footnote{1.08 [1.07], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 1,149 in Match IN task; 0.90 [1.12], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 1,088 in Mismatch OUT task}, and $\mathrm{\lVert \text{mid-rSWR}^+ \rVert}$\footnote{1.32 [1.24], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 935 in Match IN task; 1.15 [1.26], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 891 in Mismatch OUT task} was larger than $\mathrm{\lVert \text{pre-rSWR}^+ \rVert}$ in both the Match IN and Mismatch OUT tasks.\footnote{1.19 [0.96], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 673 in Match IN task; 0.94 [0.88], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 664 in Mismatch OUT task}.

\subsection{Fluctuations of Hippocampal NTs between Encoding and Retrieval States}
Subsequently, we investigated the 'direction' of the NT in relation to $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$, which was found to be dependent on memory load (Figure~\ref{fig:03}). The directions of the SWRs were determined by the NT at $-250$ ms and $+250$ ms from their center, denoted as, for example, $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR^+}}$. We calculated the cosine similarities between $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$, $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR}}$, and $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR}}$ in both SWR (SWR$^+$) and baseline periods (SWR$^-$) (Figure~\ref{fig:07}A--D).
\\

$\overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR^-}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$ exhibited a biphasic distribution.

\\
\indent
Furthermore, $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR^+}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR^+}}$ was less than $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR^-}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR^-}}$ strictly in Mismatch OUT task (Figure~\ref{fig:07}F: \textit{pink circles}). In other words, eSWR and rSWR pointed in the opposite direction exclusively in Mismatch OUT task but not Match IN task (Figure~\ref{fig:07}E: \textit{pink circles}).

\section{Discussion}
This study hypothesizes that in low-dimensional spaces during a WM task in humans, hippocampal neurons \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{form unique }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{exhibit WM-task dependent }\DIFaddend NTs, primarily during SWR periods. Initially, multi-unit spikes in the MTL regions were projected onto three-dimensional spaces during a Sternberg task using GPFA (Figure~\ref{fig:01}D--E \& Figure~\ref{fig:02}A). The NT distances across WM phases ($\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{E} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{R} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$, and $\mathrm{\lVert g_{M}g_{R} \rVert}$) were significantly larger in the hippocampus compared to the EC and amygdala (Figure~\ref{fig:02}C--E)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, indicating dynamic and responsive neural activity in the hippocampus during the WM task}\DIFdelend . Also, in the hippocampus, the NT distance between the encoding and retrieval phases ($\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{E} \rVert}$) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{correlated positively }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{positively correlated }\DIFaddend with memory load (Figure~\ref{fig:03}C--D)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, reflecting WM processing}\DIFdelend . The hippocampal \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{neural }\DIFdelend NT transiently expanded during SWRs (Figure~\ref{fig:05}). Lastly, the hippocampal \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{neural }\DIFdelend NT alternated between encoding and retrieval states, transitioning from encoding to retrieval during SWR events (Figure~\ref{fig:07}). These findings explain aspects of hippocampal neural activity during a WM task in humans and offer new insights into SWRs as a state-switching element in hippocampal neural states.

Furthermore}\DIFaddend , in the present study, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{applying }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the application of }\DIFaddend GPFA to multi-unit activity during a one-second level resolution of the WM task revealed that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{neural }\DIFdelend NT in low-dimensional space presented a memory-load dependency between the encoding and retrieval phases, denoted as $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:03}). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These findings support }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Notably, this dependency was not identified in other phase combinations. These observations suggest that the encoding and retrieval expanded in opposite directions in low-dimensional spaces. Overall, these findings not only reinforce }\DIFaddend the association of the hippocampus with WM processing \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in humans but also introduce the phenomenon of "hippocampal neural fluctuation between encoding and retrieval states"}\DIFaddend .

Our analysis focused on putative CA1 regions (Figure~\ref{fig:04}) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in order to enhance the validity of recording site and the true positive rate of SWR detection. This criterion }\DIFaddend is supported by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{several factors. This specific focus results from established observations that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{accumulated evidence.

}\DIFaddend , potentially within a 50 $\mu$m radius of the recording site \cite{schomburg_spiking_2012}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Furthermore}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Additionally}\DIFaddend , we identified \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an }\DIFdelend increased incidence of SWRs during the first 0--400 ms of the retrieval phase (Figure~\ref{fig:04}D). This finding aligns with previous reports of heightened SWR occurrence preceding spontaneous verbal recall \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

, extending our understanding to }\DIFaddend a triggered retrieval condition. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The observed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Moreover, the }\DIFaddend log-normal distributions of both SWR duration and ripple band peak amplitude \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{observed }\DIFaddend in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:04}C \& E) coincide with the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{current }\DIFdelend consensus in this field \cite{liu_consensus_2022}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Consequently, our decision to limit recording sites to putative CA1 regions likely contributed to improving the precision, or true positive rate, of SWR detection. Although, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Therefore, these results support the electrode placement and detected SWRs in this study. One could argue that }\DIFaddend the NT distance increase from $O$ during SWRs (Figure~\ref{fig:05}) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{might }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{may }\DIFaddend be artificially inflated towards higher values due to channel selection \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using UMAP clustering on spike counts. However}\DIFaddend , this potential bias does not \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{substantially challenge our main findings}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{affect the direction of NT, the memory-load dependency, nor the WM task dependency identified in this study}\DIFaddend .

Interestingly, during the retrieval phase, NT directions alternated between encoding and retrieval states during both baseline and SWR periods in a task-dependent manner (Figure~\ref{fig:07}C \& D). Additionally, the balance of this fluctuation transitioned from encoding to retrieval state during SWR events (Figure~\ref{fig:07} E \& F). These results align with previous studies on the role of SWR in memory retrieval \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{norman_hippocampal_2019} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{norman_hippocampal_2021}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{norman_hippocampal_2019, norman_hippocampal_2021}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Our findings suggest that (i) neuronal oscillation between encoding and retrieval states occurs during a WM task and (ii) SWR events serve as indicators of the transition in hippocampal neural states from encoding to retrieval during a WM task.

Moreover, our study noted differences specific to the WM-task type between encoding- and retrieval-SWRs (Figure~\ref{fig:07}E--F). Notably, opposing movements of encoding-SWR (eSWR) and retrieval-SWR (rSWR) were not observed in Match IN task but were apparent in Mismatch OUT task. Memory engram theory \cite{liu_optogenetic_2012} might explain these observations: Match In task presented participants with previously shown letters, while Mismatch OUT task introduced a new letter absent in the encoding phase. This explanation underscores the significant role of SWR in human cognitive processes.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The application of log-transformation to NT distances influences the correlation analysis in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:03}C \& D), although other statistical tests performed are nonparametric and not affected by the log-transformation.

. Furthermore, GPFA linearly projects neural spike data into a latent space, preserving the temporal structure with Gaussian processes. Therefore, if the input data, spike counts in our case, is log-normally distributed, the latent GPFA space should, ideally, reflect the log-normality. Lastly, the empirical observation of the NT distances, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:01}, supports the efficacy of our method in detecting subtle differences during baseline periods. Accordingly, the correlation analysis is the only section potentially affected by the use of log-normalization; but this approach will be justified from previous works.

In conclusion, this study illustrates that during a WM task in humans, hippocampal activity fluctuate between encoding and retrieval states, uniquely transitioning from encoding to retrieval during SWR events. These findings offer novel insights into the neural correlates and functionality of working memory within the hippocampus.

The projection was executed as follows: First, a linear transformation placed $\mathrm{g_{E}}$ at the origin $O$ (0,0), and $\mathrm{g_{R}}$ at ($\lVert \mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}} \rVert$, 0). The point cloud was subsequently rotated around the $\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}$ axis (similar to the x axis) for adaptation to two-dimensional spaces. Thus, within these two-dimensional spaces, the distances from point $O$ and the angles for the $\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}$ axis are retained as in the original three-dimensional spaces created by GPFA. Abbreviations: SWR denotes sharp-wave ripple events; eSWR refers to SWR during the encoding phase; rSWR signals SWR during the retrieval phase; SWR$^+$, characterizes an SWR event; SWR$^-$ signifies control events for SWR$^+$; pre-SWR, mid-SWR, or post-SWR, represent the time intervals from $-800$ to $-250$ ms, from $-250$ to $+250$ ms, or from $+250$ to $+800$ ms from the center of the SWR.

Also, contradicting directionality between $\protect\overrightarrow{{\mathrm{eSWR^+}}}$ and $\protect\overrightarrow{{\mathrm{rSWR^+}}}$ was observed (pink circles) not in Match IN task (\textbf{\textit{E}}), but in Mismatch OUT task (\textbf{\textit{F}}).
