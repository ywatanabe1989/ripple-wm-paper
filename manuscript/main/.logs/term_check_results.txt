- Abstract Line 5-6
  "sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) --- transient and synchronous oscillation observed in the hippocampus" -> "sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) --- a transient and synchronous oscillation observed in the hippocampus"
  Reason: Grammatical consistency

- Introduction Line 6
  "a transient, synchronized oscillation, called sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)" -> "a transient, synchronized oscillation called sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)"
  Reason: Unnecessary comma

- Introduction Line 29
  "recent studies have found" -> "Recent studies have found"
  Reason: Sentence beginning should be capitalized

- Methods Line 5-6
  "The dataset used in this study, which is publicly available, comprises nine epilepsy patients performing a modified the Sternberg task" -> "The dataset used in this study, which is publicly available, comprises nine epilepsy patients performing a modified Sternberg task"
  Reason: Typographical error

- Methods Line 30-31
  "The bin size was set to 50 ms, without overlaps." -> "The bin size was set to 50 ms without overlaps."
  Reason: Unnecessary comma

- Methods Line 36-37
  "An optimal GPFA dimensionality was found to be three using the elbow method obtained by examining..." -> "An optimal GPFA dimensionality was found to be three, determined using the elbow method by examining..."
  Reason: Clarity of sentence structure

- Methods Line 45-46
  "The resulting $^+/^-$ candidates were then visually inspected." -> "The resulting $^+/$^-$ candidates were then visually inspected."
  Reason: Consistency in notation for plus/minus candidates

- Results Line 4-5
  "during the execution of the modified Sternberg task." -> "during the execution of a modified Sternberg task."
  Reason: Typographical error

- Results Line 17-18
  "We normalized each factor per session and region, for instance, session \#2 in AHL of subject \#1." -> "We normalized each factor for each session and region, for instance, session \#2 in AHL of subject \#1."
  Reason: Clarity and grammatical consistency

- Results Line 28-29
  "The NT distance from the origin ($O$) --- represented as $ }$, $ }$, $ }$, and $ }$ --- in the hippocampus surpassed..." -> "The NT distance from the origin ($O$)---represented as $ }$, $ }$, $ }$, and $ }$---in the hippocampus surpassed..."
  Reason: Formatting consistency for em dashes

- Results Line 47-48
  "We identified five putative CA1 regions, four of which were not indicated as seizure onset zones (Table~\ref{tab:01})." -> "We identified five putative CA1 regions, four of which were identified as not being seizure onset zones (Table~\ref{tab:01})."
  Reason: Clarity and grammatical consistency

- Discussion Last Paragraph Line 5
  "opposing movements of encoding-SWR (eSWR) and retrieval-SWR (rSWR) were not observed in Match IN task but were apparent in Mismatch OUT task." -> "opposing movements of encoding-SWR (eSWR) and retrieval-SWR (rSWR) were observed not in the Match IN task but were apparent in the Mismatch OUT task."
  Reason: Clarity and grammatical consistency

- References Line 2
  "Note Re-compile is required" -> "Note: Re-compilation is required"
  Reason: Correction of phrase and formatting for clarity

- Additional Information "Declaration_of_interest" Line 3
  "The authors declare that they have no competing interests." -> "The authors declare no competing interests."
  Reason: Conciseness and grammatical preference
