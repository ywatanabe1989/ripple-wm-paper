\revTwoComment{
1. The authors provide sufficient details for most of the analysis. However, some methods are presented with insufficient details.\\
2. All the results that support the conclusion are directly shown.\\
3. I find that the conclusion drawn by the authors are an exaggerated extension of the results obtained. I think a major flaw is present in the definition of 'states', which are the core of the study. Clear definition of the term 'state' is needed, together with additional analysis to show their existence. At this stage, the results are too weak to support the conclusion.\\
4. The study complies with the ethical guidelines.\\
