Major comments:
- Defining 'encoding' and 'retrieval' states requires a careful, complete, and clear analysis. From Fig.2, it seems that NT points are scattered and do not have stable 'states'. This could be a major flaw of the study, since the 'transition between states' could be no longer valid. To define states, authors would need to explicitly show that points that belong to 'encoding' and 'retrieval' phases are clustered in different regions of the state space and have small overlap.
