Thank you for your question regarding how our findings compare with past research.\\
\\
Previous studies have indeed acknowledged the involvement of the hippocampus in working memory (WM) tasks. However, many of these studies were constrained by the temporal resolution of their methods, limiting their ability to capture the precise dynamics of memory processing. Our study advances this understanding by employing a dataset with a higher temporal resolution of 1 second, making it the first to explicitly delineate the neural fluctuations between the encoding and retrieval states during a WM task.\\
\\
This significant advancement provides detailed insights into the temporal dynamics of hippocampal activity, offering a clearer picture of how specific phases of memory processing are supported by neural mechanisms. Our findings address a crucial gap in the literature and may serve as a foundation for future research exploring the complexities of neural activity during different stages of working memory tasks.\\

According to this discussion, we have revised our manuscript as follows for better communication with readers.\\
