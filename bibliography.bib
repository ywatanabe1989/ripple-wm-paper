	abstract = {Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) constitute one of the most synchronized activation events in the brain and play a critical role in offline memory consolidation. Yet their cognitive content and function during awake, conscious behavior remains unclear. We directly examined this question using intracranial recordings in human patients engaged in episodic free recall of previously viewed photographs. Our results reveal a content-selective increase in hippocampal ripple rate emerging 1 to 2 seconds prior to recall events. During recollection, high-order visual areas showed pronounced SWR-coupled reemergence of activation patterns associated with recalled content. Finally, the SWR rate during encoding predicted subsequent free-recall performance. These results point to a role for hippocampal SWRs in triggering spontaneous recollections and orchestrating the reinstatement of cortical representations during free episodic memory retrieval.},

	abstract = {Sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) represent the most synchronous population pattern in the mammalian brain. Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during “off-line” states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, “p-ripples,” which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Mechanisms for SPW-R genesis and function are discussed in this review. © 2015 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

At the neuronal level, reactivation of awake experience in the hippocampus during sharp-wave ripple events, characteristic of slow-wave sleep, has been proposed as a neural mechanism for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. However, a causal relation between sleep reactivation and memory consolidation has not been established. Here we show that disrupting neuronal activity during ripple events impairs spatial learning. We trained rats daily in two identical spatial navigation tasks followed each by a 1-hour rest period. After one of the tasks, stimulation of hippocampal afferents selectively disrupted neuronal activity associated with ripple events without changing the sleep-wake structure. Rats learned the control task significantly faster than the task followed by rest stimulation, indicating that interfering with hippocampal processing during sleep led to decreased learning.},

After rats acquired a fear memory by receiving mild footshocks in a shock zone on a track, we analyzed place cells when the animals were placed on the track again and displayed an apparent memory retrieval behavior: avoidance of the shock zone. We found that place cells representing the shock zone were reactivated, despite the fact that the animals did not enter the shock zone. This reactivation occurred in ripple-associated awake replay of place cell sequences encoding the paths from the animal's current positions to the shock zone but not in place cell sequences within individual cycles of theta oscillation. The result reveals a specific place-cell pattern underlying inhibitory avoidance behavior and provides strong evidence for the involvement of awake replay in fear memory retrieval.},

The duration of ripples shows a skewed distribution with a minority of long-duration events. We discovered that long-duration ripples are increased in situations demanding memory in rats. Prolongation of spontaneously occurring ripples by optogenetic stimulation, but not randomly induced ripples, increased memory during maze learning. The neuronal content of randomly induced ripples was similar to short-duration spontaneous ripples and contained little spatial information. The spike content of the optogenetically prolonged ripples was biased by the ongoing, naturally initiated neuronal sequences. Prolonged ripples recruited new neurons that represented either arm of the maze. Long-duration hippocampal SPW-Rs replaying large parts of planned routes are critical for memory.},

	abstract = {Review of the normally occurring neuronal patterns of the hippocampus suggests that the two principal cell types of the hippocampus, the pyramidal neurons and granule cells, are maximally active during different behaviors. Granule cells reach their highest discharge rates during theta-concurrent exploratory activities, while population synchrony of pyramidal cells is maximum during immobility, consummatory behaviors, and slow wave sleep associated with field sharp waves. Sharp waves reflect the summed postsynaptic depolarization of large numbers of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and subiculum as a consequence of synchronous discharge of bursting CA3 pyramidal neurons. The trigger for the population burst in the CA3 region is the temporary release from subcortical tonic inhibition. An overview of the experimentally explored criteria of synaptic enhancement (intensity, frequency, and pattern of postsynaptic depolarization, calcium influx, cooperativity, threshold) suggests that these requirements may be present during sharp wave-concurrent population bursts of pyramidal cells. Experimental evidence is cited showing that (a) population bursts in CA3 may lead to long-term potentiation in their postsynaptic CA1 targets, (b) tetanizing stimuli are capable of increasing the synchrony of the sharp wave-burst, and (c) activity patterns of the neocortical input to the hippocampus determine which subgroup of CA3 neurons will trigger subsequently occurring population bursts (initiator cells). Based on the experimental evidence reviewed a formal model of memory trace formation is outlined. During exploratory (theta) behaviors the neocortical information is transmitted to the hippocampus via the fast-firing granule cells which may induce a weak and transient heterosynaptic potentiation in a subgroup of CA3 pyramidal cells. The weakly potentiated CA3 neurons will then initiate population bursts upon the termination of exploratory activity (sharp wave state). It is assumed that recurrent excitation during the population burst is strongest on those cells which initiated the population event. It is suggested that the strong excitatory drive brought about by the sharp wave-concurrent population bursts during consummatory behaviors, immobility, and slow wave sleep may be sufficient for the induction of long-term synaptic modification in the initiator neurons of the CA3 region and in their targets in CA1. In this two-stage model both exploratory (theta) and sharp wave states of the hippocampus are essential and any interference that might modify the structure of the population bursts (e.g. epileptic spikes) is detrimental to memory trace formation.},

	abstract = {The medial entorhinal cortex is part of a neural system for mapping the position of an individual within a physical environment1. Grid cells, a key component of this system, fire in a characteristic hexagonal pattern of locations2, and are organized in modules3 that collectively form a population code for the animal’s allocentric position1. The invariance of the correlation structure of this population code across environments4,5 and behavioural states6,7, independent of specific sensory inputs, has pointed to intrinsic, recurrently connected continuous attractor networks (CANs) as a possible substrate of the grid pattern1,8–11. However, whether grid cell networks show continuous attractor dynamics, and how they interface with inputs from the environment, has remained unclear owing to the small samples of cells obtained so far. Here, using simultaneous recordings from many hundreds of grid cells and subsequent topological data analysis, we show that the joint activity of grid cells from an individual module resides on a toroidal manifold, as expected in a two-dimensional CAN. Positions on the torus correspond to positions of the moving animal in the environment. Individual cells are preferentially active at singular positions on the torus. Their positions are maintained between environments and from wakefulness to sleep, as predicted by CAN models for grid cells but not by alternative feedforward models12. This demonstration of network dynamics on a toroidal manifold provides a population-level visualization of CAN dynamics in grid cells.},

	abstract = {Systems consolidation—a process for long-term memory stabilization—has been hypothesized to occur in two stages1–4. Whereas new memories require the hippocampus5–9, they become integrated into cortical networks over time10–12, making them independent of the hippocampus. How hippocampal–cortical dialogue precisely evolves during this and how cortical representations change in concert is unknown. Here, we use a skill learning task13,14 to monitor the dynamics of cross-area coupling during non-rapid eye movement sleep along with changes in primary motor cortex (M1) representational stability. Our results indicate that precise cross-area coupling between hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and M1 can demarcate two distinct stages of processing. We specifically find that each animal demonstrates a sharp increase in prefrontal cortex and M1 sleep slow oscillation coupling with stabilization of performance. This sharp increase then predicts a drop in hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWR)–M1 slow oscillation coupling—suggesting feedback to inform hippocampal disengagement and transition to a second stage. Notably, the first stage shows significant increases in hippocampal SWR–M1 slow oscillation coupling in the post-training sleep and is closely associated with rapid learning and variability of the M1 low-dimensional manifold. Strikingly, even after consolidation, inducing new manifold exploration by changing task parameters re-engages hippocampal–M1 coupling. We thus find evidence for dynamic hippocampal–cortical dialogue associated with manifold exploration during learning and adaptation.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of extracting smooth, low-dimensional neural trajectories that summarize the activity recorded simultaneously from many neurons on individual experimental trials. Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional, noisy spiking activity in a compact form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the spike trains are first smoothed over time, then a static dimensionality-reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way and that account for spiking variability, which may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories—Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA)—which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality-reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that the proposed extensions improved the predictive ability of the two-stage methods. The predictive ability was further improved by going to GPFA. From the extracted trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect that was shown indirectly by previous studies. We then show how such methods can be a powerful tool for relating the spiking activity across a neural population to the subject's behavior on a single-trial basis. Finally, to assess how well the proposed methods characterize neural population activity when the underlying time course is known, we performed simulations that revealed that GPFA performed tens of percent better than the best two-stage method.},

            Daily experience suggests that we perceive distances near us linearly. However, the actual geometry of spatial representation in the brain is unknown. Here we report that neurons in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus that mediate spatial perception represent space according to a non-linear hyperbolic geometry. This geometry uses an exponential scale and yields greater positional information than a linear scale. We found that the size of the representation matches the optimal predictions for the number of CA1 neurons. The representations also dynamically expanded proportional to the logarithm of time that the animal spent exploring the environment, in correspondence with the maximal mutual information that can be received. The dynamic changes tracked even small variations due to changes in the running speed of the animal. These results demonstrate how neural circuits achieve efficient representations using dynamic hyperbolic geometry.},

The relationship between these patterns of activity and the memory functions of the hippocampus is poorly understood. We interrupted awake SWRs in animals learning a spatial alternation task. We observed a specific learning and performance deficit that persisted throughout training. This deficit was associated with awake SWR activity, as SWR interruption left place field activity and post-experience SWR reactivation intact. These results provide a link between awake SWRs and hippocampal memory processes, which suggests that awake replay of memory-related information during SWRs supports learning and memory-guided decision-making.},

They occurred interleaved with periods characterized by load-independent high levels of alpha power and CFC. During memory activation periods, a relevant CFC parameter (load-dependent changes of the peak modulated frequency) correlated with individual WM capacity. Fluctuations between these two periods predicted successful performance and were locked to the phase of endogenous delta oscillations.

            The maintenance of items in working memory relies on persistent neural activity in a widespread network of brain areas. To investigate the influence of load on working memory, we asked human subjects to maintain sets of letters in memory while we recorded single neurons and intracranial encephalography (EEG) in the medial temporal lobe and scalp EEG. Along the periods of a trial, hippocampal neural firing differentiated between success and error trials during stimulus encoding, predicted workload during memory maintenance, and predicted the subjects’ behavior during retrieval. During maintenance, neuronal firing was synchronized with intracranial hippocampal EEG. On the network level, synchronization between hippocampal and scalp EEG in the theta-alpha frequency range showed workload dependent oscillatory coupling between hippocampus and cortex. Thus, we found that persistent neural activity in the hippocampus participated in working memory processing that is specific to memory maintenance, load sensitive and synchronized to the cortex.},

Displace units increased their rates during behaviors associated with theta activity in the hippocampal slow waves. In general these were behaviors which changed the rat's position relative to the environment.

We directly recorded from 317 neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobes while subjects explored and navigated a virtual town.

To examine the mechanisms underlying hippocampal coding, here we measured the intracellular dynamics of place cells by combining in vivo whole-cell recordings with a virtual-reality system. Head-restrained mice, running on a spherical treadmill, interacted with a computer-generated visual environment to perform spatial behaviours. Robust place-cell activity was present during movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of place fields: an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the baseline membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta oscillations, and a phase precession of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes. The virtual-reality system developed here will enable new experimental approaches to study the neural circuits underlying navigation.},

Ripples with similar characteristics are also present in humans, yet their underlying cellular correlates are still unknown. By in vivo recording interneurons and pyramidal cells in the human hippocampal formation, we find that cell type-specific firing patterns and phase-locking on a millisecond timescale can be distinguished during ripples. In particular, pyramidal cells fired preferentially at the highest amplitude of the ripple, but interneurons began to discharge earlier than pyramidal cells. Furthermore, a large fraction of cells were phase-locked to the ripple cycle, but the preferred phase of discharge of interneurons followed the maximum discharge probability of pyramidal neurons. These relationships between human ripples and unit activity are qualitatively similar to that observed in vivo in the rodents, suggesting that their underlying mechanisms are similar.},

Hippocampal place cells fire at discrete locations as subjects traverse space, thereby providing an explicit neural code for current location during locomotion. In contrast, during awake immobility, the hippocampus is thought to be dominated by neural firing representing past and possible future experience. The question of whether and how the hippocampus constructs a representation of current location in the absence of locomotion has been unresolved. Here we report that a distinct population of hippocampal neurons, located in the CA2 subregion, signals current location during immobility, and does so in association with a previously unidentified hippocampus-wide network pattern. In addition, signalling of location persists into brief periods of desynchronization prevalent in slow-wave sleep. The hippocampus thus generates a distinct representation of current location during immobility, pointing to mnemonic processing specific to experience occurring in the absence of locomotion.},

These recordings revealed significant increases in 48–90 Hz gamma oscillatory power with memory load for two classes of stimuli: letters and faces. Sites exhibiting gamma increases with memory load appeared primarily in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. These findings implicate gamma oscillatory activity in the maintenance of both letters and faces in working memory and provide the first direct evidence for modulation of hippocampal gamma oscillations as humans perform a working memory task.},

Cells that were inactive during behavior, or that were active but had non-overlapping spatial firing, did not show this increase. This effect, which declined gradually during each post-behavior sleep session, may result from synaptic modification during waking experience.

A template-matching method and a joint probability map method were used for sequence search. Repeating spike sequences in excess of chance occurrence were examined by comparing the number of repeating sequences in the original spike trains and in surrogate trains after Monte Carlo shuffling of the spikes. Four different shuffling procedures were used to control for the population dynamics of hippocampal neurons. Repeating spike sequences in the recorded cell assemblies were present in both the awake and sleeping animal in excess of what might be predicted by random variations. Spike sequences observed during wheel running were “replayed” at a faster timescale during single sharp-wave bursts of slow-wave sleep. We hypothesize that the endogenously expressed spike sequences during sleep reflect reactivation of the circuitry modified by previous experience.

Such "replay" co-occurs with ripple events: short-lasting (approximately 50-120 ms), high-frequency (approximately 200 Hz) oscillations that are associated with increased hippocampal-cortical communication. In previous studies, rats exploring small environments showed replay anchored to the rat's current location and compressed in time into a single ripple event. Here, we show, using a neural decoding approach, that firing sequences corresponding to long runs through a large environment are replayed with high fidelity and that such replay can begin at remote locations on the track. Extended replay proceeds at a characteristic virtual speed of approximately 8 m/s and remains coherent across trains of ripple events. These results suggest that extended replay is composed of chains of shorter subsequences, which may reflect a strategy for the storage and flexible expression of memories of prolonged experience.},

In the present study, we analyzed whether neurons in CA1 and the subiculum that receive EC projections are interconnected and give rise to return projections to EC, such that they terminate deep in the area of origin of the EC-to-CA1/subiculum projections. Both for the lateral and medial subdivision of EC, the projections to CA1/subiculum, as well as the projections from CA1 to the subiculum and back to EC, are rather divergent. Interestingly, we only rarely observed evidence for the presence of “reentry loops,” i.e., cells in layer III of EC giving rise to projections to interconnected neurons in CA1 and the subiculum, while the targeted CA1 neurons also projected back to the deep layers of the area of origin of the pathway in EC. We conclude that although fibers originating from a restricted part of EC distribute extensively in a divergent way along the longitudinal axis of CA1 and the subiculum, only restricted portions of the latter two areas, receiving inputs from the same entorhinal area, are interconnected. Moreover, only a small percentage of the CA1 neurons that project to the correspondingly innervated subicular neurons give rise to projections that return to the deep layers of the originating part of EC.

	abstract = {Comprehensive knowledge of the architecture of neuronal networks lies at the basis of understanding their functions. Although the anatomical connections between and within the hippocampal formation (HF) and the parahippocampal region (PHR) have been and still are being investigated extensively, for several reasons some of the PHR–HF network connections have become underexposed and this probably results in biased functional concepts.We present a comprehensive interactive knowledge base of all anatomically established PHR–HF connections in the rat. Using this knowledge base, the PHR–HF circuitry is discussed and special attention is paid to underexposed connections.The role of some of these underexposed connections is discussed in relation to three topics that are strongly associated with the PHR–HF network: memory formation, navigation and temporal dynamics.Generally it is thought that only the HF is involved in memory formation, through associating different types of information. Based on the connections observed in the interactive diagram of the knowledge base, we pose that the entorhinal cortex associates information prehippocampally at a more generic level than the HF.The CA3 recurrent network is the most prominent auto-associative network in the hippocampus and is implicated in pattern-separation and pattern-completion tasks that are relevant for memory. However, there are also recurrent networks in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, CA1 and the subiculum. They might also serve a unique role in memory, but they receive little attention.Detailed anatomical knowledge lies at the basis of the discovery of grid cells that are important for navigation. Based on details of the entorhinal–hippocampal connections, we propose that there will be differences in the modulation of firing patterns along the transverse axis in CA1 and the subiculum. The proximal part of CA1 and the distal subiculum will preferentially process spatial information, whereas the distal part of CA1 and the proximal subiculum will process non-spatial information.Although most track-tracing studies do not reveal whether a connection is excitatory or inhibitory, we suggest that some of the known connections between regions of the network are likely to be identified as inhibitory interneuron projections, based on their layer of origin. These long-range GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-ergic connections probably mediate interregional binding.Sources of detailed knowledge, such as that presented in this Review and the accompanying interactive diagram, will prevent the loss of valuable knowledge and hopefully inspire creative minds to come up with new solutions for outstanding problems in the field.},

The relative size of spatial representation by place cells in the rat hippocampus gradually increases from dorsal to ventral.By contrast, rodent gene expression studies demonstrate multiple long-axis functional domains with sharply demarcated borders: at least nine in CA3 and three in CA1 and the dentate gyrus.Hippocampal intrinsic anatomical connectivity, as well as electrophysiological measures of coherence, show abrupt division from the ventral (anterior) one-third to dorsal (posterior) two-thirds of the hippocampus.Hippocampal involvement in unconditioned fear responses is limited to the ventral one-third.When these levels of organization are superimposed, a new model of hippocampal long-axis organization emerges: gradients with discrete domains, the latter dividing the hippocampus into (at least) three portions along the long axis.This model supersedes a simple dissociation of the dorsal from the ventral hippocampus and provides a potential framework for accommodating the multiple functions ascribed to the hippocampus in rodents and primates.},

	abstract = {Recording extracellulary from neurons in the brains of animals in vivo is among the most established experimental techniques in neuroscience, and has recently become feasible in humans. Many interesting scientific questions can be addressed only when extracellular recordings last several hours, and when individual neurons are tracked throughout the entire recording. Such questions regard, for example, neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory consolidation, and the generation of epileptic seizures. Several difficulties have so far limited the use of extracellular multi-hour recordings in neuroscience: Datasets become huge, and data are necessarily noisy in clinical recording environments. No methods for spike sorting of such recordings have been available. Spike sorting refers to the process of identifying the contributions of several neurons to the signal recorded in one electrode. To overcome these difficulties, we developed Combinato: a complete data-analysis framework for spike sorting in noisy recordings lasting twelve hours or more. Our framework includes software for artifact rejection, automatic spike sorting, manual optimization, and efficient visualization of results. Our completely automatic framework excels at two tasks: It outperforms existing methods when tested on simulated and real data, and it enables researchers to analyze multi-hour recordings. We evaluated our methods on both short and multi-hour simulated datasets. To evaluate the performance of our methods in an actual neuroscientific experiment, we used data from from neurosurgical patients, recorded in order to identify visually responsive neurons in the medial temporal lobe. These neurons responded to the semantic content, rather than to visual features, of a given stimulus. To test our methods with multi-hour recordings, we made use of neurons in the human medial temporal lobe that respond selectively to the same stimulus in the evening and next morning.},

	abstract = {When monitoring neural activity using intracranial electrical recordings, researchers typically consider the signals to have two primary components: fast action potentials (APs) from neurons near the electrode, and the slower local field potential (LFP), thought to be dominated by postsynaptic currents integrated over a larger volume of tissue. In general, a decrease in signal power with increasing frequency is observed for most brain rhythms. The 100–200 Hz oscillations in the rat hippocampus, including “fast gamma” or “epsilon” oscillations and sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs), are one exception, showing an increase in power with frequency within this band. We have used detailed biophysical modeling to investigate the composition of extracellular potentials during fast oscillations in rat CA1. We find that postsynaptic currents exhibit a decreasing ability to generate large-amplitude oscillatory signals at high frequencies, whereas phase-modulated spiking shows the opposite trend. Our estimates indicate that APs and postsynaptic currents contribute similar proportions of the power contained in 140–200 Hz ripples, and the two combined generate a signal that closely resembles in vivo SPW-Rs. Much of the AP-generated signal originates from neurons further than 100 μm from the recording site, consistent with ripples appearing similarly strong regardless of whether or not they contain recognizable APs. Additionally, substantial power can be generated in the 90–150 Hz epsilon band by the APs of rhythmically firing pyramidal neurons. Thus, high-frequency LFPs may generally contain signatures of local cell assembly activation.},

Here we show that stimuli that induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a neurophysiological correlate of learning and memory, can lead to the generation of SPW-Rs in rat hippocampal slices. The induced SPW-Rs have properties that are identical to spontaneously generated SPW-Rs: they originate in CA3, propagate to CA1 and subiculum and require AMPA/kainate receptors. Their induction is dependent on NMDA receptors and involves changes in interactions between clusters of neurons in the CA3 network. Their expression is blocked by low-frequency stimulation but not by NMDA receptor antagonists. These data indicate that induction of LTP in the recurrent CA3 network may facilitate the generation of SPW-Rs.},

We report that mouse hippocampal sharp-wave ripple oscillations serve as intrinsic events that trigger long-lasting synaptic depression. Silencing of sharp-wave ripples during slow-wave states prevented the spontaneous down-regulation of net synaptic weights and impaired the learning of new memories. The synaptic down-regulation was dependent on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and selective for a specific input pathway. Thus, our findings are consistent with the role of slow-wave states in refining memory engrams by reducing recent memory-irrelevant neuronal activity and suggest a previously unrecognized function for sharp-wave ripples.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal sharp waves and the associated ripple oscillations (SWRs) are implicated in memory processes. These network events emerge intrinsically in the CA3 network. To understand cellular interactions that generate SWRs, we detected first spiking activity followed by recording of synaptic currents in distinct types of anatomically identified CA3 neurons during SWRs that occurred spontaneously in mouse hippocampal slices. We observed that the vast majority of interneurons fired during SWRs, whereas only a small portion of pyramidal cells was found to spike. There were substantial differences in the firing behavior among interneuron groups; parvalbumin-expressing basket cells were one of the most active GABAergic cells during SWRs, whereas ivy cells were silent. Analysis of the synaptic currents during SWRs uncovered that the dominant synaptic input to the pyramidal cell was inhibitory, whereas spiking interneurons received larger synaptic excitation than inhibition. The discharge of all interneurons was primarily determined by the magnitude and the timing of synaptic excitation. Strikingly, we observed that the temporal structure of synaptic excitation and inhibition during SWRs significantly differed between parvalbumin-containing basket cells, axoaxonic cells, and type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1)-expressing basket cells, which might explain their distinct recruitment to these synchronous events. Our data support the hypothesis that the active current sources restricted to the stratum pyramidale during SWRs originate from the synaptic output of parvalbumin-expressing basket cells. Thus, in addition to gamma oscillation, these GABAergic cells play a central role in SWR generation.},

Here, we simultaneously recorded intracranial EEG from the amygdala and hippocampus of epilepsy patients while performing a WM task, and compared their representation patterns during the encoding and maintenance periods. By combining multivariate representational analysis and connectivity analyses with machine learning methods, our results revealed a functional specialization of the amygdala-hippocampal circuit: The mnemonic representations in the amygdala were highly distinct and decreased from encoding to maintenance. The hippocampal representations, however, were more similar across different items but remained stable in the absence of the stimulus. WM encoding and maintenance were associated with bidirectional information flow between the amygdala and the hippocampus in low-frequency bands (1–40 Hz). Furthermore, the decoding accuracy on WM load was higher by using representational features in the amygdala during encoding and in the hippocampus during maintenance, and by using information flow from the amygdala during encoding and that from the hippocampus during maintenance, respectively. Taken together, our study reveals that WM processing is associated with functional specialization and interaction within the amygdala-hippocampus circuit.},

However, the circumstances under which the hippocampus is necessary for WM and the specific processes that it supports remain controversial. We propose that the hippocampus supports WM by binding together high-precision properties of an event, and we test this claim by examining the precision of color-location bindings in a visual WM task in which participants report the precise color of studied items using a continuous color wheel. Amnestic patients with hippocampal damage were significantly impaired at retrieving these colors after a 1-s delay, and these impairments reflected a reduction in the precision of those memories rather than increases in total memory failures or binding errors. Moreover, a parallel fMRI study in healthy subjects revealed that neural activity in the head and body of the hippocampus was directly related to the precision of visual WM decisions. Together, these results indicate that the hippocampus is critical in complex high-precision binding that supports memory over brief delays.},

abstract = {Objective. Hippocampal ripples are transient neuronal features observed in high-frequency oscillatory bands of local field potentials (LFPs), and they occur primarily during periods of behavioral immobility and slow-wave sleep. Ripples have been defined based on mathematically engineered features, such as magnitudes, durations, and cycles per event. However, the ‘ripple’ could vary from laboratory to laboratory because their definition is subject to human bias, including the arbitrary choice of parameters and thresholds. In addition, LFPs are often influenced by myoelectric noise arising from animal movement, making it difficult to distinguish ripples from high-frequency noises. These problems have to be overcome. Approach. We extracted ripple candidates under few constraints and labeled them as binary or stochastic ‘true’ or ‘false’ ripples using Gaussian mixed model clustering and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) in a weakly supervised fashion. Main results. Our automatic method separated ripples and myoelectric noise and was able to detect ripples even when the animals were moving. Moreover, we confirmed that a CNN detected ripples defined by our method. Leave-one-animal-out cross-validation estimated the accuracy, the area under the precision-recall curve, the receiver operating characteristic curve to be 0.88, 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. Significance. Our automatic ripple detection method will reduce time spent on performing laborious experiments and analyses.}

	abstract = {Cortical synaptic strengths vary substantially from synapse to synapse and exhibit a skewed distribution with a small fraction of synapses generating extremely large depolarizations. Using multiple whole-cell recordings from rat hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells, we found that the amplitude of unitary excitatory postsynaptic conductances approximates a lognormal distribution and that in the presence of synaptic background noise, the strongest fraction of synapses could trigger action potentials in postsynaptic neurons even with single presynaptic action potentials, a phenomenon termed interpyramid spike transmission (IpST). The IpST probability reached 80\%, depending on the network state. To examine how IpST impacts network dynamics, we simulated a recurrent neural network embedded with a few potent synapses. This network, unlike many classical neural networks, exhibited distinctive behaviors resembling cortical network activity in vivo. These behaviors included the following: 1) infrequent ongoing activity, 2) firing rates of individual neurons approximating a lognormal distribution, 3) asynchronous spikes among neurons, 4) net balance between excitation and inhibition, 5) network activity patterns that was robust against external perturbation, 6) responsiveness even to a single spike of a single excitatory neuron, and 7) precise firing sequences. Thus, IpST captures a surprising number of recent experimental findings in vivo. We propose that an unequally biased distribution with a few select strong synapses helps stabilize sparse neuronal activity, thereby reducing the total spiking cost, enhancing the circuit responsiveness, and ensuring reliable information transfer.},
