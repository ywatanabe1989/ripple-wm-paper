#### No. 1

- Hypothesis
  - The hippocampus exhibits E and R states.
- Data
  - d(E, R) was positively correlated with memory load in the Match IN task.
  - d(E, O), d(M, O), and d(R, O) were positively correlated with memory load in the Match IN task.
- Interpretation
  - The hippocampus exhibited E and R states.



#### No. 2

- Hypothesis
  - SWR navigates through the low-dimensional space in certain directions.
- Data
  - eSWR and rSWR directed in the opposite direction
  - rSWR converged into **the same distance** from the E state.
  - 
- Interpretation
  - eSWR and rSWR
